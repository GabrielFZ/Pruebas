#Steps to create a data pipeline using Google Analytics data

#1 Using google.oauth2, authenticate with the service-account-key.json file (you must download this file to your device first)
#2 Get data from Google analytics API into a response object, one response for each week
#3 Parse those responses and load them into pandas dataframes
#4 Load each dataframe to the Bigquery table using load_table_from_dataframe method
#5 Run the query that compares the two weeks and outputs the report
